This is the place to practice Git and GitHub
---
# Some Steps to Remember:
- Create new repo in GitHub
- Get the syntax to connect the new repo with the local git directory
- In the local directory:
  - Initiate: git init
  - Check git status: git status
  - Add file to track: git add filename
  - Commit file(s): git commit -m "Description of the change"
  - Some others useful: check the different with "git diff filename" and check the change of commit with "git log (filename(s))"
  - Then use the syntax from GitHub's new repo to push the commited file into GitHub
