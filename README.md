This is the place to practice Git and GitHub
---
### Some Steps to Remember First:
- Create new repo in GitHub
- Get the syntax to connect the new repo with the local git directory
- In the local directory:
  - Initiate: git init
  - Check git status: git status
  - Add file to track: git add filename
  - Commit file(s): git commit -m "Description of the change"
  - Some others useful: check the different with "git diff filename" and check the change of commit with "git log (filename(s))"
  - Then use the syntax from GitHub's new repo to push the commited file into GitHub

### Undo changes:
There are couple of ways to reest our work as below:
- git reset HEAD filename: Take the file name out of staging area
- git checkout HEAD filename: Discard changes in the working directory
- git reset commit_SHA: reset to previous commit with its 7-digit commit_SHA. This is to reset the HEAD to the specific commit; however, the change is still on the working directory. Need to run Git checkout HEAD filename to discard changes in the working directory and back to the previous commit.

Difference between check out and reset:
